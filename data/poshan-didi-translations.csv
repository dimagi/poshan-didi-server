1_7_3_ebfacts,,"Here are these facts!
-> Exclusive breastfeeding gives an infant the best chance to grow and stay healthy. 
-> It promotes production of more milk. 
-> Giving other food or fluids reduces the amount of breastmilk the child takes and, as a result, the amount of breastmilk the mother produces too is reduced. 
-> It decreases the transmission of germs from the environment. Water, feeding bottles, and utensils can pass germs to the young infant, even when they appear “clean”. The infant can become sick from the germs. 
-> It ensures that the milk the child gets is nutritious. Breast-milk contains all the nutrients that a baby needs during the first 6 months of life. Other foods or fluids may be too diluted or thin and can be contaminated. 
-> It provides enough iron. Iron contributes to the development of the brain, and helps the child focus attention. Iron from breast-milk is absorbed better. 
-> Young infants often have difficulty digesting animal milk. 
-> Animal milk may cause diarrhoea, rashes, or other allergies. Diarrhoea may continue and become persistent, leading to undernutrition

1_7_4_expmilk,,"Expressing milk can be useful in several situations especially for feeding a young infant too weak to attach well to the nipple. Most newborns and young infants are strong enough to begin suckling right away. However, a baby may be low weight or for other reasons too weak to take enough milk. It may be necessary to express milk from the breast, and give it to the baby in small sips with a spoon or a small katori. Discourage the use of a feeding bottle. The use of the nipple on the feeding bottle will interfere with the newborn’s suckling on the breast. This makes it more difficult for the newborn to breastfeed effectively. Also, a bottle and nipple are more difficult to clean well than a katori.",,
1_7_5_expmilksteps,,"» Mother should express the breast-milk herself 
» She should wash her hands well before expressing the milk and sit comfortably and hold a clean katori near her breast 
» She should put her thumb above the nipple and areola on the breast and her first finger below the nipple and areola. After this she should support her breast with other fingers. 
» The mother should then press the thumb and first finger towards the chest wall. She should press her breast behind the nipple and areola between her finger and thumb. Then she should press and release alternately. This should not hurt. 
» The milk may take some time to flow so do not be alarmed. After pressing several times the milk will begin to flow. The milk may come out in streams. Avoid squeezing the nipple since this may hurt. 
» Express one breast for about five minutes and wait for the milk flow to slow down. Then express the other side and then repeat both. It takes about 20-30 minutes to express the breast-milk especially during the first few days since only little milk may be produced.
