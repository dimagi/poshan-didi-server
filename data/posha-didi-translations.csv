skin2skin_definition,,"Skin to skin contact also known as kangaroo mother care is a technique of newborn care where babies are kept chest-to-chest and skin-to-skin with a parent, typically their mother. Skin-to-skin contact is really good for the health of your baby, so you may want to try it in the future. I recommend that you spend at least one hour giving your baby skin-to-skin contact every day.",
skin2skin_howto,,"For skin-to-skin contact, you and [child name] can spend quality time together on a daily basis. In fact, you can move around as you normally do while giving your child skin-to-skin contact. 
     -->To get started, [child name] should be naked and your chest area should be bare. Rest [child name] upright on your chest so your skin is touching their face, chest, stomach, and arms. Their head should be turned to one side with their legs in a bent position. 
     -->Then, using a long piece of cloth, wrap [child name] against your chest so they are securely attached to your chest and won't move when you stand up. You can then wear your clothes over the cloth as normal. 
     -->You can stay in this position while you move around throughout the day and while sleeping at night. You only need to remove the child to change their diaper or give them a bath.",

bf_vomiting,,"Does [child‚Äôs name] sometimes vomit out the milk after they breastfeed? It is important that after every time you breastfeed your child, you take them and make them burp by softy patting on their back. Child‚Äôs body is small and therefore there is little gap between the stomach and the food pipe, which is why if the milk does not reach the stomach and is not digested, the child vomits it out. If the problem continues you should consult your AWW!

",
sanitation_importance,,"Children are more likely to attract flies, who cause a lot of diseases, when they are left with poor hygienic conditions, for instance, babies with runny nose or suffering from diarrhea. Moreover, babies inactive at the time of sleep or due to sickness also attract flies.Which is why when we talked previously, we emphasized on the importance of the baby being active. It is also very important that you do not practice open defecation nor do you teach your child to do so since the same is a cause of several diseases and other dangers. ",
poorsanitation_effect,,"Nutritional status is compromised where people are exposed to high levels of infection due to unsafe and insufficient water supply and inadequate sanitation. In secondary malnutrition, people suffering from diarrhoea will not benefit fully from food because frequent stools prevents adequate absorption of nutrients. Worldwide, malnutrition affects one in three people and each of its major forms dwarfs most other diseases globally (WHO, 2000). Malnutrition affects all age groups, but it is especially common among those with inadequate access to health education and to clean water and good sanitation. Which is why it is extremely important that you take care of the sanitation and hygiene of not just [child‚Äôs name] but the entire family. ",

dairrhea_causes,,Diarrhea can be a sign of poor sanitation and hygiene üíß. You can take steps to prevent [child name] from getting diarrhea in the future by maintaining good sanitation and hygiene practices in your home. ,
diarrhea_care,,"Since diarrhea causes a loss of a lot of nutrients from the body of the child, it is important therefore that the same is replenished and compensated for. If the child has diarrhoea you should give them ORS and breastfeed the child more than usual to maintain their strength. ORS is available at any medical store and also with your AWW. Unless told by a doctor, you should not give them anything else, not even water!",
childfeces_disposal,,"An important component of maintaining sanitation and hygiene is the safe disposal of child feces since the same could be a breeding ground for flies, scavengers etc. Children are more susceptible to fecal pathogens than adults due to their habits.  While crawling or playing, children may put contaminated fingers, pica or fomites into their mouth. The safest way is to dispose the fecal matter in a toilet/latrine. All other methods are considered unsafe.  Problems associated with open defecation include serious respiratory issues, stomach illness (Typhoid and Jaundice), and malaria apart from diarrhea. ",
handwashing,,"Hands should be washed on a regular basis, especially after using the washroom/changing the baby's diaper and before breastfeeding the child. Also, breasts should be wiped before breastfeeding the child. Using soap is a simple way to prevent the spread of infection and to keep you and your baby healthy üë∂üèΩ. You might want to place a bar of soap next to all water sources in your house to make it easier to wash your hands with soap every time. ",
babybottles_toys,,"Did you know that using a baby bottle to feed your child can actually make them sick? üçº Bottles are difficult to clean thoroughly, so germs can unintentionally be transferred to your child. It is recommended by many experts to stop all bottle feeding and switching to exclusive breastfeeding to avoid unintended sickness for your baby ü§±üèΩ. 
While babies are young, they often put things in their mouths while they are playing üë∂üèΩ. It's important to keep these objects clean and sanitized so they don't transfer germs to the baby while playing. ",

gmchart_explanation,gmchart_boy (.jpg),"This is known as a Growth Monitoring chart. Every month, your AWW based on the age of your child and their weight, marks a point of the graph.

feeding_techniques,,"
One of the different ways the nutrition of a child can be improved is through increased understanding of feeding techniques. While the scope of feeding techniques is vast, some of the things I can tell you about are: 
1) Number of times a child should be fed 
2) Recognizing signs of hunger in your child 
3) Importance of exclusive breastfeeding 
4) Expressing milk- meaning and purpose 
5) Steps to express milk
",
feeding_frequency ,,"[Child‚Äôs name]‚Äôs stomach is small. Therefore he/she should be fed frequently on demand‚Äîat least 8 ‚Äî 12 times in 24 hours, day and night‚Äîin order to be adequately nourished. Breastfeeding helps the mother and baby to form a close loving relationship which makes mothers feel deeply satisfied emotionally.",
recognizing_hunger,,"With time you will learn how to recognize the [child‚Äôs name]‚Äôs way of communicating hunger. She/he might rub the mouth with a fist, start to fuss, or open the mouth wide towards the breast. These are indications that the she/he is ready for breastfeeding. You should not need to wait until the [child‚Äôs name] cries before you recognizes hunger and gives the baby your breast. The mother should not wait for the baby to cry before feeding it. Crying is a late sign of hunger. ",
ebf_importance ,,"Here are these facts!
-> Exclusive breastfeeding gives an infant the best chance to grow and stay healthy. 
-> It promotes production of more milk. 
-> Giving other food or fluids reduces the amount of breastmilk the child takes and, as a result, the amount of breastmilk the mother produces too is reduced. 
-> It decreases the transmission of germs from the environment. Water, feeding bottles, and utensils can pass germs to the young infant, even when they appear ‚Äúclean‚Äù. The infant can become sick from the germs. 
-> It ensures that the milk the child gets is nutritious. Breast-milk contains all the nutrients that a baby needs during the first 6 months of life. Other foods or fluids may be too diluted or thin and can be contaminated. 
-> It provides enough iron. Iron contributes to the development of the brain, and helps the child focus attention. Iron from breast-milk is absorbed better. 
-> Young infants often have difficulty digesting animal milk. 
-> Animal milk may cause diarrhoea, rashes, or other allergies. Diarrhoea may continue and become persistent, leading to undernutrition
",
expressingmilk_meaning,,"Expressing milk can be useful in several situations especially for feeding a young infant too weak to attach well to the nipple. Most newborns and young infants are strong enough to begin suckling right away. However, a baby may be low weight or for other reasons too weak to take enough milk. It may be necessary to express milk from the breast, and give it to the baby in small sips with a spoon or a small katori. Discourage the use of a feeding bottle. The use of the nipple on the feeding bottle will interfere with the newborn‚Äôs suckling on the breast. This makes it more difficult for the newborn to breastfeed effectively. Also, a bottle and nipple are more difficult to clean well than a katori.",
expressingmilk_steps,,"¬ª Mother should express the breast-milk herself 
¬ª She should wash her hands well before expressing the milk and sit comfortably and hold a clean katori near her breast 
¬ª She should put her thumb above the nipple and areola on the breast and her first finger below the nipple and areola. After this she should support her breast with other fingers. 
¬ª The mother should then press the thumb and first finger towards the chest wall. She should press her breast behind the nipple and areola between her finger and thumb. Then she should press and release alternately. This should not hurt. 
¬ª The milk may take some time to flow so do not be alarmed. After pressing several times the milk will begin to flow. The milk may come out in streams. Avoid squeezing the nipple since this may hurt. 
¬ª Express one breast for about five minutes and wait for the milk flow to slow down. Then express the other side and then repeat both. It takes about 20-30 minutes to express the breast-milk especially during the first few days since only little milk may be produced.
